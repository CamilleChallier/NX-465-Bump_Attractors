# NX-465 - Bump Attractors
NX-465 Mini-project 2 : Path Integration using Coupled Bump Attractors.

Ants and various other animal species can navigate back to their nest after foraging trips without depending on visual cues. This ability, known as **path integration**, involves maintaining an internal estimate of the relative position of their nest while moving. It is essential for this memory mechanism to be capable of rapid updates while reliably maintaining its state over an extended period. A prevalent theory regarding the neural substrate of this memory suggests that the information is preserved in a bump attractorâ€™s state. Bump attractors are recurrent neural networks that preserve a localised peak of neural activity. They can encode an agent's spatial position by representing it as the position of this 'activity bump' within the network. To verify this hypothesis, we have simulated this process by implementing a neural circuit that integrates the ant's movements in two dimensions to continuously estimate its current position.
